#Read and Write one character at a time from an existing file to a new file
The purpose of this project is to read one character from a file,
write the character to another file, and then display the character on the screen.
Before running the program, you need to create a text file called haiku.txt with the
contents shown in the file, and save it in the same directory as the executable program. 
In the program lsiting, there is a function called CharReadWrite(), which has two file pointers
as its arguments. (See the declaration of the CharReadWrite() function inprogram line - OneCharAtaTime.c file.

#Project 2: Read and write one line of character at a time from an existing file to a new file
Same as the above purpose but prints one line of character at a time. see the declaration of the lineCharReadWrite() function in the program line - OneLineCharAtaTime.c file
