Greetings!, I just wannna use this time out to wish you all a happy new month of September. While we still have a few months from now to the end of this year, I just thought I should make a simple but yet a useful Calendar project in "C" programming Language to remind us of that task we promised ourselves to accomplish by the end of this year 2022. Yes, you may think you have plenty of time to achieve that goal, but it's also very important to keep an accurate and up to date calendar of due dates. 


Hence, this Calendar project is unique in the sense that it requires you to enter the year of your choice, press enter key then sit back and watch how the program uses your input to display all the months, weeks and days of that year. Just think about the yearly Calendar you have at home, in your office, school, church, etc. Exactly what I'm talking about.

You want to prioritize schedules in your daily work, this calendar project is the real deal. You want to understand the logic behind it, kindly checkout the complete source code here , feel free to fork it from my Github repository if you wish to modify and add more features to it. 


My Love for Computer programming na die.
